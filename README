## Introduzione
This study analyzes the flooding of a message in a network by exploiting the trickle
relaying policy. To do so, a 2D floorplan is considered on which N users are randomly dropped, communication is performed per slot and each user sends a message
(if it has to) to all neighbours in a radius R.
The trickle relaying protocol provides that a user, upon receipt of a collision-free
message, waits for T slots, if during that period it correctly receives less than m
copies of the message, it relays it, otherwise it stops.
Several scenarios will be evaluated in the course of the study, in particular:
* sending the message after T slots or after T+λT slots, λT 2 N; λT 2 [0; T −1]
* dropping user on 2D floorplan with uniform or normal distribution
* consider topologies where users can be disconnected from the network containing the initiator or networks where all users can be reached by redropping
those that are disconnected
